I did this whole experiment according to [r0ysue's article.](https://github.com/r0ysue/AndroidSecurityStudy/blob/master/FRIDA/A02/README.md)

My environment:

The phone:

​        Android 7.1.1

​        3.10.73-nethunter-angler-1.1



Of course, I modified some of his code and I didn't write scripts for demo2. I don't remember what demo4.js is for, but I think a smart guy like you can figure it out by yourself ;)

Also you can try to write scripts for demo2 by yourself. It's a good exercise. I hope this repo can help you. Good luck.
